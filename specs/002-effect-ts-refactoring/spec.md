## üìã Quick Guidelines
- Focus on WHAT improvements are needed and WHY
- Avoid HOW to implement (no specific Effect-TS APIs)
- Written for development team understanding refactoring benefits

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Development team needs to refactor the RSS feed worker to use Effect-TS patterns for improved type safety, error handling, and maintainability while preserving all existing functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current Promise-based code, **When** refactored to Effect-TS, **Then** error handling becomes more explicit and composable
2. **Given** the hardcoded environment variable access, **When** refactored with service abstraction, **Then** configuration becomes testable and mockable
3. **Given** the direct HTTP calls, **When** refactored with HttpService, **Then** retry logic and error handling become consistent
4. **Given** the scattered logging, **When** refactored with Effect Logger, **Then** structured logging improves observability
5. **Given** all existing functionality, **When** refactoring is complete, **Then** RSS feeds continue to be processed and Discord notifications sent correctly

### Edge Cases
- How does refactored code handle Cloudflare Worker runtime constraints?
- What happens when Effect-TS services fail during RSS processing?
- How are existing KV storage operations preserved during refactoring?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain all existing RSS feed processing functionality
- **FR-002**: System MUST replace Promise chains with Effect-TS composition patterns
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement service abstraction layer for HTTP, KV, Discord, and RSS operations
- **FR-004**: System MUST replace try-catch error handling with Effect-TS error types
- **FR-005**: System MUST implement structured logging using Effect Logger
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain compatibility with Cloudflare Workers runtime
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve existing scheduled execution behavior
- **FR-008**: System MUST improve testability through dependency injection patterns
- **FR-009**: System MUST implement type-safe configuration management
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain existing performance characteristics

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Refactoring MUST NOT introduce breaking changes to external behavior
- **NFR-002**: Code MUST become more maintainable through explicit error handling
- **NFR-003**: Services MUST be independently testable through abstraction
- **NFR-004**: Type safety MUST improve through Effect-TS patterns

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **HttpService**: Abstraction for HTTP requests with retry logic and error handling
- **RssService**: RSS feed parsing and processing operations
- **DiscordService**: Discord webhook sending with rate limit handling
- **KvStorageService**: Cloudflare KV operations abstraction
- **ConfigService**: Environment variable and configuration management
- **HealthService**: Worker health status and metrics collection
- **LoggerService**: Structured logging implementation
